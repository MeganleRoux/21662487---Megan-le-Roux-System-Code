# 21662487---Megan-le-Roux-System-Code
Created by M le Roux (21662487) to satisfy the requirements of Stellenbosch University Mechatronics Project 488 in 2023.

This project aims to design an IoT water level monitoring system that can be implemented in remote areas, with little to no network connectivity, and water storage points 
located significant distances from one another. 

This repository includes the system code of the concept demonstrator consisting of a gateway node, a complete system node and an incomplete system node that was
tested and documented in a final year document.
